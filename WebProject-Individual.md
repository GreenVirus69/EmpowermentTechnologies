# Web Project

Using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), or [W3.CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/), create one of the following:

- your personal blog site
- your personal photo portfolio site
- a corporate site for a fictional (or real) company
- a product site for a fictional (or real) product

The site should have:
- a landing page (index.html)
- two or more content pages (blog posts, full photo page, company details, product details, etc.)

Here are links to some templates you can use:

Bootstrap

- https://bootstrapmade.com
- https://themeforest.net/tags/bootstrap (not free)

Zurb
- http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.html

W3.CSS
- https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp

I recommend W3.CSS because it is small, easy to learn and easy to modify. However if you want to go one step higher and are really serious about web development, feel free to use Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation.
