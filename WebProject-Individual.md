# Web Project

This will be your project for the second quarter and will comprise 30% of your grade.

Due Date: September 29, 2017

By 23:59PM September 29, 2017, your site should be viewable on http://yourgithubusername.github.io/website/index.html

Please treat this as mini-web project, as if you are building an actual web site and the class instructor is your client. To make things simpler, you are free to use your own content for this project. In an actual web project, the client will be dictating the content that will go into the web site.

You are required to submit two weekly written status reports on September 20/21 and September 27/28. Follow this [status report template](status-report-template.md)

Your grade will be based on:
- The web site itself: 70%
  - Responsiveness: 40% 
    - How responsive is the site? 
    - Does it render properly on a mobile device with a small screen or are portions of pages cut off?
    - Does it render properly on a big screen (2048 pixels wide) and use the extra screen size to show more information or use a better layout?
    - Does it use a different layout when rendered in a small screen vs. when rendered in a big screen?
  - Aesthetics: 20%
    - Does the site look good?
  - Code quality: 30%
    - Is the HTML and CSS code well-organized?
    - Are there comments in the code to help guide future programmers who will work on it? Are the comments informative yet concise?
  - Content: 10%
    - Does the site have real (or fictional) content that is meant to really exercise the template? Or is it using placeholder text copied over from the template?
    
- Status reports: 30%
  - Do the status reports reflect the actual status of the project (code in github)?
  - Are the status reports delivered in a timely manner?
  - Was the project delivered in a consistent pace (e.g. 33% done before the first status report, 33% done after the second status report, 100% done on or before the due date)

## Requirements

Using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), or [W3.CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/), create one of the following:

- your personal blog site
- your personal photo portfolio site
- a corporate site for a fictional (or real) company
- a product site for a fictional (or real) product

The site should have:
- a landing page (index.html)
- two or more content pages (blog posts, full photo page, company details, product details, etc.)

Here are links to some templates you can use:

Bootstrap
- https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/
- https://bootstrapmade.com
- https://themeforest.net/tags/bootstrap (not free)

Zurb
- http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.html

W3.CSS
- https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp

I recommend W3.CSS because it is small, easy to learn and easy to modify. However if you want to go one step higher and are really serious about web development, feel free to use Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation.
