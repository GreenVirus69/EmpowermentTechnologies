# Seatwork 2

At the end of this exercise, you should learn: 

- How to implement several common web page layouts
- How to use web fonts
  
### Step 0. Plan ahead.

You will spend the last 5 minutes of the class writing your reflection about this activity. Plan to finish coding at 7:55 AM.

### Step 1. Fork the boilerplate project 

To get up to speed quickly, we'll start with a boilerplate HTML. Feel free to replace this with your own content if you prefer (and have the time). 

Log in to Github, open this repository: https://github.com/JBRC-ph/css-seatwork-2, and click the Fork link at the upper right portion of the page.

NOTE: You can work by directly editing the HTML and CSS file from Github.com. However, changes on your code can take a few minutes to propagate to Github Pages. I recommend cloning the repository locally and edit the web page using Visual Studio Code. After each CSS change, reload index.html in your browser to see how the CSS change affects the layout of the page.

### Step 2. Enable Github Pages for the project

This will let you open the HTML code in your browser as a web page, and not just as HTML code. For instructions on how to do this, see https://github.com/JBRC-ph/EmpowermentTechnologies/blob/master/github-pages-howto.md#5-enable-github-pages-for-the-project (skip to Step 5).

### Step 3. Test your workflow

Open your project. Make some changes in index.html. Reload the page in your browser, and verify that the change you made is reflected. 

This test ensures that the file you're editing is the same one you're testing :)

### Step 4. Work on Exercise 1.

On this step you will implement this layout:

![3-section-layout](https://github.com/JBRC-ph/EmpowermentTechnologies/blob/master/images/Body-3sections.png)

Follow these sub-steps for this exercise.

### Step 5. Work on Exercise 2.

On this step you will implement this layout:

![3-column-layout](https://github.com/JBRC-ph/EmpowermentTechnologies/blob/master/images/Body-3columns.png)

Follow these sub-steps for this exercise.

### Step 6. Work on Exercise 3.

On this step you will implement this layout:

![3-column-layout](https://github.com/JBRC-ph/EmpowermentTechnologies/blob/master/images/Combination.png)

### Step 11. Upload to Github.

If you worked locally, upload your work to Github and view your work in https://yourusername.github.io/css-seatwork-1/index.html

Write your reflection.

Congratulations, you're done!

Further study: Read about the CSS properties you used today (e.g. Google "css float mdn" or "css float w3schools"):
  - margin
  - padding
  - list-style-none
  - float
  - display
  - text-decoration
  - background-color
  - hover
